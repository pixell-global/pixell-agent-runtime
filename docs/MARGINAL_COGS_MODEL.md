## Cost Variable Classification

### Fixed Costs (F) - Infrastructure Independent of Agent Count

These costs remain constant regardless of the number of agents hosted:

| Variable | Description | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| `C_alb` | Application Load Balancer | $27.88 | Fixed + traffic-based LCU |
| `C_nlb` | Network Load Balancer | $20.58 | Fixed + traffic-based NLCU |
| `C_nat` | NAT Gateway (2×) | $67.05 | Fixed + data processing ($0.045/GB) |
| `C_nat_data` | NAT data processing | ~$2.25 | Variable: $0.045 × GB_transferred |
| `C_cm_ns` | Cloud Map namespace | $1.00 | One namespace for all agents |
| `C_ecr` | ECR repository | $0.20 | Shared container images |
| `C_s3_infra` | S3 infrastructure buckets | $0.50 | Shared across agents |
| `C_logs_infra` | CloudWatch logs (infra) | $1.00 | ECS/ALB system logs |

**Total Fixed Costs (F):**
```
F = C_alb + C_nlb + C_nat + C_nat_data + C_cm_ns + C_ecr + C_s3_infra + C_logs_infra
F = $27.88 + $20.58 + $67.05 + $2.25 + $1.00 + $0.20 + $0.50 + $1.00
F = $120.46/month
```

### Semi-Variable Costs (S) - Depends on Architecture

These costs vary based on the deployment architecture:

| Variable | Description | Multi-Agent Cost | Per-Agent Cost |
|----------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| `C_rds` | Database instance | $14.71 | $14.71 |
| `C_fargate_runtime` | Fargate runtime task | $72.08 | $0 |
| `C_logs_runtime` | Runtime logs | $1.80 | $0 |

**Semi-Variable Costs (S):**

For **Multi-Agent Runtime**:
```
S_multi = C_rds + C_fargate_runtime + C_logs_runtime
S_multi = $14.71 + $72.08 + $1.80 = $88.59/month
```

For **Per-Agent Tasks**:
```
S_single = C_rds
S_single = $14.71/month
```

### Variable Costs (V) - Per Agent

These costs scale linearly with the number of agents:

| Variable | Description | Cost per Agent | Architecture |
|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| `C_fargate_agent` | Fargate task per agent | $7.39 (vCPU) + $1.62 (RAM) | Per-agent only |
| `C_logs_agent` | CloudWatch logs per agent | $0.50 | Per-agent only |
| `C_s3_agent` | S3 APKG storage per agent | $0.01 | Per-agent only |
| `C_cm_instance` | Cloud Map instance | ~$0.001 | Per-agent only |

**Variable Cost per Agent (V):**

For **Multi-Agent Runtime**:
```
V_multi = $0/agent  (all agents share one container)
```

For **Per-Agent Tasks**:
```
V_single = C_fargate_agent + C_logs_agent + C_s3_agent + C_cm_instance
V_single = $7.39 + $1.62 + $0.50 + $0.01 + $0.001
V_single = $9.52/agent
```

## Mathematical Models

### Model 1: Multi-Agent Runtime (Current Architecture)

**Total Cost Function:**
```
TC_multi(n) = F + S_multi + (V_multi × n)

Where:
- n = number of agents (0 ≤ n ≤ 20)
- F = $120.46 (fixed infrastructure)
- S_multi = $88.59 (shared runtime)
- V_multi = $0 (zero marginal cost per agent)

TC_multi(n) = $120.46 + $88.59 + ($0 × n)
TC_multi(n) = $209.05  (constant for 0 ≤ n ≤ 20)
```

**Average Cost per Agent:**
```
AC_multi(n) = TC_multi(n) / n
AC_multi(n) = $209.05 / n
```

**Marginal Cost (cost of nth agent):**
```
MC_multi = ∂TC_multi/∂n = $0/agent

For n ∈ [1, 20]: MC = $0
For n > 20: Need additional runtime, MC jumps to $209.05
```

**Cost per Agent Examples:**
```
n = 1:  AC = $209.05/agent,  MC = $0
n = 5:  AC = $41.81/agent,   MC = $0
n = 10: AC = $20.91/agent,   MC = $0
n = 20: AC = $10.45/agent,   MC = $0
n = 21: AC = $20.20/agent,   MC = $209.05 (new runtime needed)
```

### Model 2: Per-Agent Tasks (Isolated Architecture)

**Total Cost Function:**
```
TC_single(n) = F + S_single + (V_single × n)

Where:
- n = number of agents (n ≥ 1)
- F = $120.46 (fixed infrastructure)
- S_single = $14.71 (database only)
- V_single = $9.52 (per agent compute)

TC_single(n) = $120.46 + $14.71 + ($9.52 × n)
TC_single(n) = $135.17 + $9.52n
```

**Average Cost per Agent:**
```
AC_single(n) = TC_single(n) / n
AC_single(n) = ($135.17 / n) + $9.52
```

**Marginal Cost (cost of nth agent):**
```
MC_single = ∂TC_single/∂n = $9.52/agent  (constant)
```

**Cost per Agent Examples:**
```
n = 1:   AC = $144.69/agent, MC = $9.52
n = 10:  AC = $23.04/agent,  MC = $9.52
n = 50:  AC = $12.22/agent,  MC = $9.52
n = 100: AC = $10.87/agent,  MC = $9.52
```

---

## Marginal Cost Analysis

### Definition of Marginal Cost

**Marginal Cost (MC)** = The cost of hosting one additional agent

**Formula:**
```
MC = TC(n) - TC(n-1)
```

Or equivalently:
```
MC = ∂TC/∂n  (derivative of total cost with respect to agent count)
```

### Marginal Cost by Architecture

| Architecture | Marginal Cost | Capacity Constraint |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Multi-Agent Runtime** | **$0/agent** | Maximum 20 agents per runtime |
| **Per-Agent Tasks** | **$9.52/agent** | Unlimited (practical: 1000s) |

### Marginal Cost with Multiple Runtimes

For **Multi-Agent Runtime** with multiple runtime instances:

```
Let:
- m = number of runtime instances
- n = total number of agents
- k = capacity per runtime = 20 agents

Number of runtimes needed: m = ⌈n/k⌉

TC_multi_scaled(n) = F + (S_multi × m)
TC_multi_scaled(n) = $120.46 + ($88.59 × ⌈n/20⌉)

Marginal cost:
- If n mod 20 ≠ 0: MC = $0 (adding to existing runtime)
- If n mod 20 = 0: MC = $88.59 (new runtime needed)
```

**Example:**
```
n = 19: TC = $120.46 + $88.59 = $209.05,  MC = $0
n = 20: TC = $120.46 + $88.59 = $209.05,  MC = $0
n = 21: TC = $120.46 + $177.18 = $297.64, MC = $88.59 (stepped increase!)
n = 22: TC = $297.64,                      MC = $0
```

---

## Cost Optimization Model

### Objective Function

**Minimize**: Average cost per agent

```
Minimize: AC(n) = TC(n) / n
```

### Decision Variables

| Variable | Description | Domain |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `n` | Number of agents | n ∈ ℕ⁺ (positive integers) |
| `arch` | Architecture choice | arch ∈ {multi, single} |
| `m` | Number of multi-agent runtimes | m ∈ ℕ⁺ |

### Constraints

**Multi-Agent Runtime:**
```
n ≤ 20m  (capacity constraint)
m ≥ ⌈n/20⌉  (minimum runtimes needed)
```

**Per-Agent Tasks:**
```
No hard capacity constraint (practical limit: cloud account limits)
```

### Optimal Architecture Selection

**Decision Rule:**
```
Choose Multi-Agent if: AC_multi(n) < AC_single(n)

Solving for break-even point:
$209.05/n = $135.17/n + $9.52

$209.05/n - $135.17/n = $9.52
$73.88/n = $9.52
n = $73.88 / $9.52
n ≈ 7.76 agents
```

**Interpretation:**
- For **n ≤ 7**: Per-agent tasks are cheaper
- For **n ≥ 8**: Multi-agent runtime is cheaper
- At **n = 20**: Multi-agent is optimal ($10.45 vs $12.22)

But this ignores the step function! Let's recalculate considering multiple runtimes:

### Break-Even Analysis: Multi vs Per-Agent

**Comparing costs at different scales:**

| Agents (n) | Multi-Agent Cost | Per-Agent Cost | Optimal |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | $209.05 | $144.69 | Per-Agent ✓ |
| 5 | $209.05 | $182.77 | Multi-Agent ✓ |
| 10 | $209.05 | $230.37 | Multi-Agent ✓ |
| 20 | $209.05 | $325.57 | Multi-Agent ✓ |
| 21 | $297.64 | $335.09 | Multi-Agent ✓ |
| 40 | $297.64 | $515.97 | Multi-Agent ✓ |
| 50 | $386.23 | $611.17 | Multi-Agent ✓ |
| 100 | $651.00 | $1,087.17 | Multi-Agent ✓ |

**Conclusion:** Multi-agent runtime is optimal for **n ≥ 5 agents**

## Detailed Cost Variables Reference

### AWS Service Cost Components

#### 1. ECS Fargate Costs

**Pricing (us-east-2):**
- vCPU: $0.04048/vCPU-hour
- Memory: $0.004445/GB-hour

**Multi-Agent Runtime Task (2 vCPU, 4 GB):**
```
C_fargate_runtime = (2 × $0.04048 × 730) + (4 × $0.004445 × 730)
C_fargate_runtime = $59.10 + $12.98 = $72.08/month
```

**Per-Agent Task (0.25 vCPU, 0.5 GB):**
```
C_fargate_agent = (0.25 × $0.04048 × 730) + (0.5 × $0.004445 × 730)
C_fargate_agent = $7.39 + $1.62 = $9.01/month
```

#### 2. RDS Database Costs

**MySQL db.t3.micro (current):**
```
C_rds = (Instance hours) + (Storage)
C_rds = ($0.017 × 730) + (20GB × $0.115)
C_rds = $12.41 + $2.30 = $14.71/month
```

**Scaling considerations:**
- For 1-50 agents: db.t3.micro adequate ($14.71/month)
- For 50-200 agents: db.t3.small recommended ($29.20/month)
- For 200+ agents: db.t3.medium recommended ($58.40/month)

**Database cost as function of agent count:**
```
C_rds(n) = {
  $14.71   if n ≤ 50
  $29.20   if 50 < n ≤ 200
  $58.40   if n > 200
}
```

#### 3. Load Balancer Costs

**ALB (Application Load Balancer):**
```
C_alb = (Fixed) + (LCU hours)
C_alb = $16.20 + (LCU × $0.008 × 730)

Current: C_alb ≈ $27.88/month  (assumes ~2 LCU average)
```

**LCU (Load Balancer Capacity Unit) depends on:**
- New connections per second
- Active connections per minute
- Processed bytes
- Rule evaluations

**Scaling behavior:**
- LCU scales with traffic, not agent count
- Estimate: +0.5 LCU per 10 high-traffic agents

**NLB (Network Load Balancer):**
```
C_nlb = (Fixed) + (NLCU hours)
C_nlb = $16.20 + (NLCU × $0.006 × 730)

Current: C_nlb ≈ $20.58/month  (assumes ~1 NLCU average)
```

#### 4. NAT Gateway Costs

**Cost structure:**
```
C_nat = (Fixed per gateway) + (Data processing)
C_nat = (n_gateways × $0.045/hour × 730) + (GB_processed × $0.045)
C_nat = (n_gateways × $32.85) + (GB_processed × $0.045)

Current: C_nat = (2 × $32.85) + (50GB × $0.045) = $67.95/month
```

**Data processing scales with:**
- Agent package downloads (one-time per deployment)
- Outbound API calls from agents
- Database queries (if RDS in private subnet)

**Optimization:**
- S3 VPC Endpoint: Eliminates S3 traffic through NAT (free)
- ECR VPC Endpoint: Eliminates image pull traffic ($7.20/month)
- Single NAT: Reduce from 2 to 1 gateway (saves $32.85/month)

#### 5. CloudWatch Logs

**Cost structure:**
```
C_logs = (Ingestion) + (Storage)
C_logs = (GB_ingested × $0.50) + (GB_stored × $0.03)
```

**Multi-Agent Runtime:**
```
C_logs_runtime = (2GB ingestion/month × $0.50) + (5GB storage × $0.03)
C_logs_runtime = $1.00 + $0.15 = $1.15/month
```

**Per-Agent Task:**
```
C_logs_agent = (1GB ingestion/month × $0.50) + (1GB storage × $0.03)
C_logs_agent = $0.50 + $0.03 = $0.53/month per agent
```

**Note:** Actual log volume depends on agent verbosity and traffic

#### 6. S3 Storage

**Cost structure:**
```
C_s3 = (Storage) + (Requests) + (Data transfer)
C_s3 = (GB × $0.023) + (Requests/1000 × $0.0004) + (GB_transfer × $0.09)

Data transfer out: First 100GB/month free
```

**APKG Storage per Agent:**
```
Assume 50MB package per agent:
C_s3_agent = (0.05GB × $0.023) + (10 requests/month × $0.0004/1000)
C_s3_agent ≈ $0.001/month per agent (negligible)
```

#### 7. Cloud Map (Service Discovery)

**Cost structure:**
```
C_cm = (Hosted zone) + (Queries)
C_cm = $1.00/month + (Queries × $0.0000001)

Queries are effectively free (millions of queries = pennies)
```

**Per-Agent Instance:**
```
C_cm_instance ≈ $0.001/month per agent (negligible)
```

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Impact of Key Variables

**Sensitivity to Agent Count (n):**

```
∂(AC_multi)/∂n = -$209.05/n²  (decreasing with n)
∂(AC_single)/∂n = -$135.17/n²  (decreasing with n)

Both average costs decrease as n increases, but multi-agent decreases faster.
```

**Sensitivity to Database Cost:**

```
If C_rds increases by $X:
- Multi-agent AC increases by: $X/n
- Per-agent AC increases by: $X/n

Same impact on both architectures (database is shared in both)
```

**Sensitivity to Fargate Cost:**

```
If Fargate prices increase by 10%:
- Multi-agent: C_fargate_runtime increases to $79.29 (+$7.21)
  → AC_multi(20) = $10.81/agent (+$0.36)
- Per-agent: C_fargate_agent increases to $9.91 (+$0.90)
  → AC_single(20) = $16.99/agent (+$0.90)

Multi-agent is less sensitive to Fargate price changes.
```

**Sensitivity to NAT Gateway Cost:**

```
Reducing from 2 to 1 NAT Gateway:
- Saves: $32.85/month
- Multi-agent AC(20): $10.45 → $8.81/agent (-15.7%)
- Per-agent AC(20): $12.22 → $10.58/agent (-13.4%)
```

## Summary: Key Formulas

### Multi-Agent Runtime

```
Total Cost: TC(n) = $120.46 + $88.59 × ⌈n/20⌉

Average Cost: AC(n) = TC(n) / n

Marginal Cost: MC(n) = {
  $0        if n mod 20 ≠ 1
  $88.59    if n mod 20 = 1 (new runtime needed)
}
```

### Per-Agent Tasks

```
Total Cost: TC(n) = $135.17 + $9.52n

Average Cost: AC(n) = $135.17/n + $9.52

Marginal Cost: MC(n) = $9.52  (constant)
```

### Optimal Decision Rule

```
Choose Multi-Agent if n ≥ 5 agents

Cost savings = TC_single(n) - TC_multi(n)
```
